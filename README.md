# 💰 Centsible Budget App

Centsible is a budgeting web application built with React that helps users manage their income and expenses—including recurring transactions—with a clean, user-friendly interface.

## 📌 Project Purpose

Centsible was developed as a personal finance management tool during my time at Nucamp Coding Bootcamp. It reflects core web development skills—React, component-driven architecture, state management—and aims to be a helpful real-world budgeting solution for individuals and families.
